Hania:
You may add contact person name, phone, email (about order)  BUT ONLY SALES PERSON IS ALLOWED TO MAKE THE CONTACT WITH THE BUYER.  NO ONE ELSE. 
I would like to see system defaulting and displaying sales by the ship date on both screens sale and shipment - from the closest ship date to the furthest. 
Also, I would like to see a visual of the status. I mentioned this before- add a colored line/bar  reflecting that status. 
Also, the system should be producing daily reports automatically by the end of each day with a list of orders approaching to be fulfilled within 10 days.
